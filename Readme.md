# Project Description

In this project, I apply **data importing and cleaning** skills to uncover insights about the Airbnb market in New York City.

The packages and tools used here are utilized by data scientists everyday since so much of the world's data is stored in unconventional formats and is not clean or analysis-ready. I first import the data from multiple file types and then combine them to answer questions about the Airbnb market in New York. I also use string cleaning and date manipulation skills to extract accurate information from the datasets. 

## The goal of this project is to convert untidy data into appropriate formats to analyze, and answer key questions including:

- What is the average price, per night, of an Airbnb listing in NYC?
- How does the average price of an Airbnb listing, per month, compare to the private rental market?
- How many adverts are for private rooms?
- How do Airbnb listing prices compare across the five NYC boroughs?

## Project Tasks:

1. Importing the Data
2. Cleaning the price column
3. Calculating average price
4. Comparing costs to the private rental market
5. Cleaning the room type column
6. What timeframe are we working with?
7. Joining the DataFrames
8. Analyzing listing prices by NYC borough
9. Price range by borough

The project is done in **Python** using **pandas** and can be found on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/).
